    <p> The ride sharing bonanza continues! Seeing the success of notable players like Uber and Lyft, </br> 
        you've decided to join a fledgling ride sharing company of your own. In your latest capacity, </br>
        you'll be acting as Chief Data Strategist for the company. In this role, you'll be expected </br>
        to offer data-backed guidance on new opportunities for market differentiation.</p></br>
    </br>
    <p>You've since been given access to the company's complete recordset of rides. </br>
        This contains information about every active driver and historic ride, </br>
        including details like city, driver count, individual fares, and city type.</p> </br>

    <p> Your objective is to build a Bubble Plot that showcases the relationship </br>
         between four key variables:

        </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li> Average Fare ($) Per City
        <li> Total Number of Rides Per City
        <li> Total Number of Drivers Per City
        <li> City Type (Urban, Suburban, Rural)
    </ul>
